Second attempt at a photo viewer for windows vista
Windows Vista has no good picture viewer and I decided to create one. I didn't mean to actually solve the problem at first, I wanted to test drawing of simple controls
and what not and creating a some what structured application. It could be better, but it kinda works. Picto Vi3w3r was my first attempt at it. I have to keep it because it reminds me of how failure
looks like.
